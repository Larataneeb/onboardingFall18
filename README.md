# onboardingFall18

Congratulations on joining DEV - we are very excited to have you on board!

Before you join a project team, however, we need to complete a few training stages
designed to get you up to speed with our stack. As such, we will be making a
site in React which stores "todos," designed to introduce you to core aspects of
frontend web development.

Stage 0: Getting Started

This project assumes basic knowledge of git and JavaScript. If you feel like you need a brushup, I'd encourage you
to take some time looking at our training documents found in the dev-general repository at `dev-general/technical.`

Open a terminal and make a local clone of the repository by running the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/jbperry004/onboardingFall18.git
```

Navigate into that directory and make your own branch of the repository by running

```
git checkout -b <YOUR_NAME>
```

Next, run the following command to install all the app's dependencies

```
npm i
```

Finally, run the following command to start the app

```
npm run start
```

You should now be able to view the app in a browser at `localhost:3000`

Stage 1: Basic Functionality
